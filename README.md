# GAS-ICS-Sync

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here](https://script.google.com/d/1QeZFLSM1EkuFvYcryECI_xH-IZVe1-IxGRq_n6OoXp1CmVtSeTeigEx4/edit?usp=sharing) 

This is a standalone script (that consists of multiple files). The purpose is to sync ics/ical calendars to Google Calendar. Google Calendar *can* already do this, but updates only happen once every 12 or even 24 hrs. This script can be run much more frequently.
