This fork combines the filter branch and option to set removing of old events. There has also been some minor changes to the default settings. 
The main purpose of this fork is so that it can be used with a specific company rostering application that generates a webcals link but has TZID and content issues. The changes include forcing of UTC for all events, default settings and included filters. 
I will include a script to change events based on content, and I plan on including it with the install function - when I get around to it.

### ⚠️⚠️ This project is looking for contributors and people to help answer questions! Please message @developers on the Discord! ⚠️⚠️

This is a standalone script (that consists of multiple files). The purpose is to sync ics/ical calendars to Google Calendar. Google Calendar *can* already do this, but updates only happen once every 12 or even 24 hrs. This script can be run much more frequently.

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here](https://script.google.com/d/1BOk8MDLbLaHh6SwG1M1tsgNXjkcC-79LE0QoipRuTDxbO3fMVvqoROQD/edit?newcopy=true)

**To make a copy in the new Google Apps Script interface:**
1. Go to the project overview icon on the left (looks like this: ⓘ)
2. Click the "copy" icon on the top right (looks like two files on top of each other)

**NOTE:** If too many people are accessing the file at the same time, Google may lock you out. You can follow these instructions to set up the script: https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/wiki/Setting-up-the-script-manually
